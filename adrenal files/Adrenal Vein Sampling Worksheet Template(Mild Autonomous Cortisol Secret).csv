"Catheterization of an AV was considered successful if plasma epinephrine (Epi) concentration in the AV was 100 pg/ml above the PV (AV–PV >100 pg/ml), per protocol by Young et al. [6]. ",,,,,
Cortisol gradients were then calculated by computing the AV/PV ratios. Only the AV cortisol values from samples with Epi levels >100 pg/ml above the PV were included in the analysis. ,,,,,
We calculated the AV/PV ratio for each adrenal gland using the mean of the values. Side-to-side (higher cortisol/lower cortisol) cortisol lateralization ratios (CLR) were also calculated. ,,,,,
"The data were analyzed using criteria from study by Young et al. of an AV/PV cortisol ratio of >6.5 on one side and ≤3.3 on the contralateral side, and CLR ≥ 2.3 to indicate a unilateral cortisol-secreting adenoma. ",,,,,
A CLR of ≤2 was used to indicate bilateral cortisol hypersecretion [6].,,,,,
