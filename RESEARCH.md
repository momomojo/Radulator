# ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) - Comprehensive Research Document

## Executive Summary

The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a validated 10-point quantitative topographic CT scan scoring system developed to assess early ischemic changes in acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory stroke. Originally published in 2000 by Barber et al., ASPECTS has become the standard tool for patient selection in mechanical thrombectomy trials and clinical practice.

## 2. Scoring Algorithm

### Overview

ASPECTS is a 10-point scoring system where:
- **Score of 10** = Normal CT, no visible ischemic changes
- **Score of 0** = Diffuse MCA territory ischemia
- **Subtract 1 point** for each of the 10 defined regions showing early ischemic change

### The 10 Anatomically Defined Regions

#### Subcortical Structures (4 regions) - Ganglionic Level

| Region | Abbreviation | Anatomical Definition |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Caudate Head | **C** | Head of caudate nucleus |
| Lentiform Nucleus | **L** | Putamen and globus pallidus combined |
| Internal Capsule | **IC** | Posterior limb of internal capsule |
| Insular Ribbon | **I** | Insular cortex |

#### Cortical MCA Regions (6 regions)

**At Ganglionic Level (M1-M3):**

| Region | Anatomical Definition | Location |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| **M1** | Frontal operculum | Anterior MCA cortex |
| **M2** | Anterior temporal lobe | MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon |
| **M3** | Posterior temporal lobe | Posterior MCA cortex |

**At Supraganglionic Level (M4-M6):**

| Region | Anatomical Definition | Location |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| **M4** | Anterior MCA territory | Immediately superior to M1 |
| **M5** | Lateral MCA territory | Immediately superior to M2 |
| **M6** | Posterior MCA territory | Immediately superior to M3 |

> **Important Note:** M1-M6 refer to cortical regions, NOT the anatomical segments of the middle cerebral artery vessel itself.

### Assessment Levels

The MCA territory is assessed on axial CT images at two distinct levels:

1. **Ganglionic Level:** All axial cuts at the level of the caudate head or below
   - Assesses: C, L, IC, I, M1, M2, M3

2. **Supraganglionic Level:** All axial cuts above the caudate head level
   - Assesses: M4, M5, M6

### What Constitutes Early Ischemic Change

Early ischemic changes detectable on non-contrast CT include:
- **Focal hypoattenuation (hypodensity)** - tissue density less than contralateral normal brain
- **Loss of gray-white matter differentiation**
- **Sulcal effacement** - from cytotoxic edema
- **Loss of insular ribbon sign**
- **Obscuration of lentiform nucleus**

### Scoring Process

1. Start with score of 10
2. Systematically evaluate each of the 10 regions
3. Subtract 1 point for each region with visible early ischemic change
4. Record final ASPECTS score (0-10)

## 3. Clinical Application

### Thrombectomy Eligibility (Current Guidelines)

#### Within 6 Hours of Symptom Onset (Standard Window)

Based on 2015 landmark trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, SWIFT PRIME, REVASCAT, EXTEND-IA):

| Criterion | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| ASPECTS threshold | **>= 6** |
| Age | >= 18 years |
| Occlusion site | Internal carotid artery or proximal MCA (M1) |
| NIHSS | >= 6 |
| Pre-stroke disability | Minimal (mRS 0-1) |

#### Extended Window (6-24 Hours)

Based on DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials:
- Requires advanced imaging (CT perfusion or MRI)
- Selection based on clinical-imaging mismatch
- DEFUSE-3 excluded patients with ASPECTS < 6

### Large Core Strokes (ASPECTS 3-5)

Recent trials (SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT, RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, TENSION, LASTE) have demonstrated benefit of EVT in patients with:
- ASPECTS 3-5
- Within 6 hours (strongest evidence)
- Higher risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage

### Thrombolysis Decision Support

| ASPECTS Score | Clinical Implication |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 8-10 | Low infarct burden; favorable for thrombolysis |
| 6-7 | Moderate ischemia; thrombolysis reasonable |
| <= 7 | Increased risk of poor 3-month outcome and symptomatic hemorrhage |
| 0-5 | Large infarct core; individualized decision needed |

### Prognosis Prediction

From the original Barber et al. study:
- **Sharp increase in dependence and death occurs with ASPECTS <= 7**
- ASPECTS independently predicts functional outcome at 3 months
- Each 1-point decrease in ASPECTS associated with worse outcomes

---

## 4. Imaging Modalities

### Non-Contrast CT ASPECTS (Original)

- **Gold standard** for ASPECTS assessment
- Widely available and rapid acquisition
- Sensitivity improves with time from symptom onset
- Within first 3 hours, only ~30% of patients show ASPECTS < 10
- Detection improves significantly after 3 hours

**Limitations:**
- Subtle early changes may be missed in hyperacute phase (< 3 hours)
- Reader experience affects reliability
- Window/level settings important for optimal visualization

### CT Perfusion ASPECTS

- Cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps approximate infarct core
- Better correlation with final infarct in early time window
- Used in SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, DEFUSE-3 trials
- Mismatch ratio calculations possible

**Correlation with DWI:**
- CT-based and MRI-based mismatch concordant in ~90% of cases (kappa = 0.80)
- CBF and Tmax thresholds used for penumbra estimation

### MRI DWI ASPECTS

- **Most sensitive** for early infarct detection
- RESCUE-Japan LIMIT used MRI-based assessment
- DWI lesion reflects irreversibly injured infarct core
- Not as widely available in acute setting
- Longer acquisition time

### Comparative Performance

| Modality | Strengths | Limitations |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| NCCT | Widely available, fast, standard | Lower sensitivity < 3 hours |
| CTP | Better early detection, mismatch analysis | Radiation, contrast, post-processing |
| MRI DWI | Highest sensitivity for core | Availability, time, contraindications |

---

## 5. Interobserver Reliability

### Summary of Key Studies

| Study | Finding | Kappa/ICC |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Original Barber et al. 2000 | Good agreement, superior to 1/3 MCA rule | Not specified |
| Real-time vs Expert ASPECTS | Substantial agreement | kappa_w = 0.69 |
| Total ASPECTS | Substantial reliability | kappa ~0.6-0.7 |
| Dichotomized ASPECTS (>= 7 vs < 7) | **Moderate** reliability only | Lower kappa |

### Key Reliability Findings

1. **Overall Agreement:** ASPECTS demonstrates superior interobserver agreement compared to the traditional "1/3 MCA rule"

2. **Real-Time Assessment:** Weighted kappa = 0.69 between real-time clinical ASPECTS and expert review

3. **Dichotomization Problem:** When ASPECTS is dichotomized at a specific threshold (e.g., >= 6 vs < 6), interobserver reliability decreases from substantial to moderate

4. **Automated vs Human:** Software analysis shows substantial agreement (kappa = 0.78-0.92) with consensus scores, often exceeding human raters in early time windows

### Sources of Disagreement

1. **Subtle early changes** - especially within first 3 hours
2. **M region boundaries** - variation in anatomical interpretation
3. **Old vs new infarcts** - distinguishing chronic from acute changes
4. **Slice thickness** - affects visibility of small changes
5. **Window/level settings** - inconsistent viewing parameters

### Training Considerations

- Neuroradiologists and stroke neurologists with >= 2 years experience show better agreement
- Standardized training improves consistency
- Use of anatomical templates enhances reliability
- Computer-aided detection (CAD) tools can improve accuracy

## 6. Clinical Trials Evidence

### 2015 Landmark Thrombectomy Trials

| Trial | ASPECTS Criterion | Time Window | Key Finding |
|-------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **MR CLEAN** | No strict cutoff | 6 hours | 94.4% had ASPECTS > 5 |
| **ESCAPE** | >= 6 | 12 hours | Significant benefit with ASPECTS >= 6 |
| **SWIFT PRIME** | >= 6 | 6 hours | Strong EVT benefit |
| **EXTEND-IA** | >= 6 | 6 hours | Benefit with perfusion mismatch |
| **REVASCAT** | >= 7 | 8 hours | EVT superior to medical therapy |

### Extended Window Trials

#### DAWN Trial
- **DOI:** [10.1056/NEJMoa1706442](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706442)
- **Window:** 6-24 hours
- **Selection:** Clinical-imaging mismatch
- **NNT:** 2 for better disability score; 2.8 for functional independence

#### DEFUSE 3 Trial
- **DOI:** [10.1056/NEJMoa1713973](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1713973)
- **Window:** 6-16 hours
- **Selection:** Target mismatch on perfusion imaging
- **Excluded:** ASPECTS < 6
- **Finding:** 3-fold increase in functional recovery

### Large Core Trials (ASPECTS 3-5)

| Trial | Year | DOI | Population | Key Finding |
|-------|------|-----|------------|-------------|
| **RESCUE-Japan LIMIT** | 2022 | [10.1056/NEJMoa2118191](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2118191) | ASPECTS 3-5 | Better outcomes with EVT; more ICH |
| **SELECT2** | 2023 | [10.1056/NEJMoa2214403](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2214403) | ASPECTS 3-5 or core >= 50mL | EVT superior within 24 hours |
| **ANGEL-ASPECT** | 2023 | [10.1056/NEJMoa2213379](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2213379) | ASPECTS 3-5 (any volume) or 0-2 (70-100mL) | Stopped early for efficacy |
| **TENSION** | 2023 | - | Large core | EVT benefit confirmed |
| **LASTE** | 2023 | - | Large core | 55.9% had ASPECTS 0-2 |

### Meta-Analyses

**Pooled Analysis of Large Core Trials (2024):**
- 6 RCTs, 1665 patients with ASPECTS 3-5
- EVT significantly increased functional independence (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.89-3.29)
- Higher risk of symptomatic ICH with EVT

**ASPECTS 0-2 Meta-Analysis (2024):**
- 4 RCTs, 301 patients with very low ASPECTS
- Significant shift toward better outcomes favoring EVT (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.29-2.04)
- Challenges use of ASPECTS alone for treatment selection

---

## 7. Limitations and Caveats

### Anatomical Limitations

#### Posterior Circulation NOT Covered

ASPECTS was designed exclusively for MCA territory strokes. It does **NOT** assess:
- Basilar artery territory
- Posterior cerebral artery territory
- Vertebral artery territory
- Cerebellar infarcts
- Brainstem infarcts

**Alternative:** pc-ASPECTS (posterior circulation ASPECTS) has been developed for posterior circulation stroke assessment.

### Temporal Limitations

#### Early Ischemic Changes Timing

| Time from Onset | Detection Rate | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| 0-3 hours | ~30% have ASPECTS < 10 | Subtle changes difficult to detect |
| 3-6 hours | Improved detection | Clear correlation with time |
| > 6 hours | Better visibility | Hyperdense artery sign less common |

- Within first 3 hours, ASPECTS decline is not strongly associated with time
- Beyond 3 hours, significant relationship between ASPECTS decline and time
- Collateral circulation may mask true extent of ischemia

### Technical Limitations

1. **Subtle Hypodensity Detection**
   - Requires optimal window/level settings
   - Slice thickness impacts visualization (5mm optimal)
   - Beam hardening artifacts can obscure findings

2. **Interobserver Variability**
   - Moderate agreement when dichotomized at clinical thresholds
   - Disagreement affects treatment decisions
   - ~10-15% of patients may be incorrectly classified

3. **Reversibility**
   - CT hypodensity may partially reverse after successful reperfusion
   - "Ghost infarct core" phenomenon on CT perfusion
   - NCCT may overestimate early ischemic core

### Clinical Limitations

1. **Binary Threshold Challenges**
   - Using ASPECTS >= 6 as hard cutoff may exclude patients who could benefit
   - Recent trials support treatment down to ASPECTS 3-5
   - Individual patient factors must be considered

2. **Volume Estimation**
   - ASPECTS provides regional, not volumetric assessment
   - Same ASPECTS score can represent different infarct volumes
   - CT perfusion core volume may be more accurate

3. **Non-MCA Strokes**
   - Cannot be applied to ACA or PCA territory
   - Lacunar strokes not assessable
   - Watershed infarcts may be underestimated

## 8. pc-ASPECTS (Posterior Circulation ASPECTS)

### Overview

Developed by Puetz et al. (2008) to extend ASPECTS methodology to posterior circulation strokes.

### Scoring System

**10-point scale with the following regions:**

| Region | Points | Bilateral |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Thalamus | 1 each | Yes (2 total) |
| Occipital lobe | 1 each | Yes (2 total) |
| Cerebellar hemisphere | 1 each | Yes (2 total) |
| Pons | 2 | No |
| Midbrain | 2 | No |

### Validation

- **Meta-analysis DOI:** [10.1371/journal.pone.0246906](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246906)
- OR 1.66 per score decrease for unfavorable outcome
- Binary pc-ASPECTS (cutoff 6-9) significantly predicted outcomes (OR 3.91)
- BASILAR registry study: DOI [10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.031371](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.031371)

## 11. Calculator Implementation Considerations

### Required Inputs

For a clinical ASPECTS calculator, the following inputs would be needed:

1. **Subcortical Regions (4 checkboxes):**
   - Caudate (C) - affected: yes/no
   - Lentiform (L) - affected: yes/no
   - Internal Capsule (IC) - affected: yes/no
   - Insular Ribbon (I) - affected: yes/no

2. **Cortical Regions (6 checkboxes):**
   - M1 (Frontal operculum) - affected: yes/no
   - M2 (Anterior temporal) - affected: yes/no
   - M3 (Posterior temporal) - affected: yes/no
   - M4 (Superior to M1) - affected: yes/no
   - M5 (Superior to M2) - affected: yes/no
   - M6 (Superior to M3) - affected: yes/no

### Output

- **ASPECTS Score:** 0-10 (10 minus number of affected regions)
- **Interpretation category:**
  - 8-10: Minimal ischemic changes
  - 6-7: Moderate ischemic changes
  - 3-5: Large core (recent trial support for EVT)
  - 0-2: Very large core

### Clinical Decision Thresholds

| Score Range | Traditional Interpretation | Current Evidence |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| >= 6 | Favorable for thrombectomy | Standard threshold |
| 3-5 | Previously excluded | EVT beneficial (SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT) |
| 0-2 | Large infarct, poor prognosis | Emerging data suggests some benefit |

### Educational Content to Include

1. Anatomical diagrams showing the 10 regions at ganglionic and supraganglionic levels
2. Explanation of scoring method (subtract from 10)
3. Links to primary references
4. Disclaimer about clinical decision-making context
5. Note about limitations (MCA territory only, operator-dependent)
