# SHIM Score Calculator Documentation

## Overview
The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), also known as the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), is a validated 5-question assessment tool for erectile dysfunction (ED). It is one of the most widely used screening instruments for ED in both clinical practice and research.

## Clinical Significance

### Purpose
- **Primary Use**: Screening and severity assessment of erectile dysfunction
- **Clinical Applications**:
  - Initial ED assessment in primary care and urology settings
  - Treatment monitoring and response evaluation
  - Clinical trial endpoints
  - Population-based epidemiological studies

### Validation
The SHIM/IIEF-5 has been extensively validated across multiple studies:
- **Original IIEF Development**: Rosen et al., 1997 - comprehensive psychometric validation
- **IIEF-5 Validation**: Rosen et al., 1999 - demonstrated high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (88%)
- **Diagnostic Evaluation**: Cappelleri et al., 2005 - confirmed diagnostic utility
- **Clinical Guidelines**: Endorsed by AUA (American Urological Association) guidelines

## Scoring Methodology

### Questions (5 Total)
Each question assesses a different domain of erectile function over the past 6 months:

1. **Confidence** (Q1): Confidence in getting and keeping an erection
   - Range: 1-5 points
   - Options: Very low (1) to Very high (5)

2. **Firmness** (Q2): Frequency of erections hard enough for penetration
   - Range: 0-5 points
   - Options: No sexual activity (0), Almost never (1) to Almost always (5)

3. **Maintenance** (Q3): Frequency of maintaining erection after penetration
   - Range: 0-5 points
   - Options: Did not attempt (0), Almost never (1) to Almost always (5)

4. **Difficulty** (Q4): Difficulty maintaining erection to completion
   - Range: 0-5 points
   - Options: Did not attempt (0), Extremely difficult (1) to Not difficult (5)

5. **Satisfaction** (Q5): Frequency of satisfactory intercourse
   - Range: 0-5 points
   - Options: Did not attempt (0), Almost never (1) to Almost always (5)

### Total Score Calculation
- **Range**: 0-25 points (clinical range typically 5-25)
- **Method**: Simple summation of all 5 question scores
- **Interpretation**: Lower scores indicate more severe ED

## Severity Classifications

### Score Ranges and Interpretations

#### 22-25: No ED
- **Classification**: No evidence of erectile dysfunction
- **Interpretation**: Erectile function is normal
- **Management**: No specific ED treatment needed; maintain healthy lifestyle

#### 17-21: Mild ED
- **Classification**: Mild erectile dysfunction
- **Interpretation**: Minimal impairment of erectile function
- **Management**:
  - Consider lifestyle modifications (exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation)
  - Counseling and education
  - Medical treatment may be beneficial if desired
  - Rule out underlying cardiovascular risk factors

#### 12-16: Mild-to-Moderate ED
- **Classification**: Mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction
- **Interpretation**: Moderate impairment affecting sexual function
- **Management**:
  - Medical evaluation and treatment options discussion
  - PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) are often effective
  - Address cardiovascular risk factors
  - Psychological counseling if indicated

#### 8-11: Moderate ED
- **Classification**: Moderate erectile dysfunction
- **Interpretation**: Significant impairment of erectile function
- **Management**:
  - Medical evaluation recommended
  - Treatment with PDE5 inhibitors or other therapies should be considered
  - Comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular health
  - Evaluate for underlying conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)

#### 5-7: Severe ED
- **Classification**: Severe erectile dysfunction
- **Interpretation**: Marked impairment or absence of erectile function
- **Management**:
  - Comprehensive medical evaluation recommended
  - Identify underlying causes (vascular, neurologic, endocrine, psychological)
  - Multiple treatment options should be explored:
    - PDE5 inhibitors (higher doses may be needed)
    - Intracavernosal injections
    - Vacuum erection devices
    - Penile prosthesis (if refractory)
  - Cardiovascular and metabolic assessment

#### 0-4: Severe ED (with no sexual activity)
- **Classification**: Severe erectile dysfunction (may include no sexual activity)
- **Interpretation**: Complete absence of erectile function or sexual activity
- **Management**:
  - Comprehensive medical evaluation recommended
  - Consider cardiovascular and endocrine assessment as clinically indicated
  - Psychological evaluation for depression, anxiety, relationship issues
  - All treatment modalities should be discussed

## Clinical Interpretation

### Key Clinical Threshold
- **Score ≤21**: Indicates some degree of erectile dysfunction requiring clinical attention
- **Score 22+**: Normal erectile function

### Important Considerations

1. **Temporal Context**: Assessment is based on the past 6 months of sexual activity

2. **Diagnostic Utility**:
   - High sensitivity (98%) for detecting ED
   - High specificity (88%) for ruling out ED in healthy men
   - Optimal cutoff score: ≤21 for identifying any ED

3. **Limitations**:
   - Self-reported questionnaire (subject to recall bias)
   - Does not identify specific etiology of ED
   - May not capture complexity of sexual dysfunction
   - Cultural and linguistic factors may affect interpretation

4. **ED as a Vascular Risk Marker**:
   - ED often precedes cardiovascular disease by 2-5 years
   - Patients with ED should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors
   - Consider screening for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia

## Clinical Workflow

### Initial Assessment
1. Patient completes SHIM questionnaire
2. Calculate total score
3. Classify ED severity
4. Determine appropriate next steps

### Management Pathway
```
Score 22-25 (No ED)
├─ Reassurance
└─ Lifestyle counseling

Score 17-21 (Mild ED)
├─ Lifestyle modifications
├─ Counseling
├─ Consider PDE5 inhibitors if desired
└─ Screen for cardiovascular risk factors

Score 12-16 (Mild-to-Moderate ED)
├─ Medical evaluation
├─ PDE5 inhibitors first-line therapy
├─ Cardiovascular assessment
└─ Psychological counseling if indicated

Score 8-11 (Moderate ED)
├─ Comprehensive medical evaluation
├─ PDE5 inhibitors or alternative therapies
├─ Investigate underlying conditions
└─ Cardiovascular workup

Score 1-7 (Severe ED)
├─ Comprehensive medical and psychological evaluation
├─ Identify specific etiology
├─ Multiple treatment options
├─ Cardiovascular and endocrine assessment
└─ Consider referral to specialist
```
