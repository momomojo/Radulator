  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Radulator ("we," "our," or "us") operates the website radulator.com (the "Site"), which provides free,
    evidence-based medical calculators for healthcare professionals and medical learners. This Privacy Policy
    explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our Site.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using radulator.com, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
  <p>
    When you submit our website feedback form (powered by Formspree), we may collect the following
    information. This form is used solely to gather feedback for improving the Site and is not used to
    collect any clinical or patient data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> (required) — to identify the feedback source</li>
    <li><strong>Email</strong> (required) — to respond to your feedback</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Type</strong> (required) — Bug Report, Feature Request, or General Feedback</li>
    <li><strong>Calculator</strong> (optional) — to identify the relevant calculator</li>
    <li><strong>Message</strong> (required) — to receive your detailed feedback</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> The feedback form is used solely to collect user suggestions, bug reports,
    and general feedback to improve the website. We do not collect any patient data, protected health
    information (PHI), or clinical data through the Site. Our calculators operate entirely in your browser
    and do not transmit calculation inputs or results to our servers.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to collect anonymized usage data. The following events are tracked:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Calculator Selected:</strong> Which calculator a user opens</li>
    <li><strong>Calculation Performed:</strong> When a calculation is run (not the inputs or results)</li>
    <li><strong>Calculator Result Viewed:</strong> When results are displayed</li>
    <li><strong>File Download:</strong> When a file is downloaded</li>
    <li><strong>Outbound Link Click:</strong> When an external link is clicked</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Submitted:</strong> When the feedback form is submitted</li>
    <li><strong>Search Queries:</strong> Calculator search terms entered in the search box</li>
    <li><strong>Reference Link Clicks:</strong> Which external reference links you click from calculator pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Google Analytics may also collect standard web analytics data such as your IP address (anonymized),
    browser type, device type, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, and time spent on pages.
    This data is processed by Google under its own
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
  <p>
    Radulator itself does not set cookies or use browser local storage. However, Google Analytics uses
    cookies (primarily <code>_ga</code> and <code>_gid</code>) to distinguish unique visitors. You can
    control cookies through your browser settings or by using the
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.
