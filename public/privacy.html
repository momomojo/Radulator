  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Radulator ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
    use, and protect information when you use our medical calculator website at radulator.com.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
  <p>
    When you use our calculators, you may enter clinical values such as measurements, lab results,
    or patient parameters. <strong>This data is processed entirely in your browser and is never transmitted
    to our servers.</strong> We do not store, collect, or have access to any patient data or clinical
    information you enter.
  </p>

  <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Pages visited, calculators used, time spent on site</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Browser type, operating system, screen resolution</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> General geographic region (country/city level, not precise location)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use automatically collected information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand which calculators are most useful</li>
    <li>Improve user experience and site performance</li>
    <li>Analyze aggregate usage patterns</li>
    <li>Display relevant advertisements (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors use our site. Google Analytics collects
    information such as how often users visit, what pages they visit, and what other sites they
    used prior to coming to our site. We use this information to improve our service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google Analytics uses cookies. You can opt out by installing the
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.

  <h3>Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    We may display advertisements through Google AdSense or similar services. These services may use
    cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this or other websites. You can opt out of

    control cookies through your browser settings. Note that disabling cookies may affect site functionality.

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect or store personal health information, there is no PHI (Protected Health
    Information) at risk. All calculations are performed locally in your browser. We use HTTPS to
    encrypt data in transit.
  </p>

  <h3>Calculator Data</h3>
  <p>
    All calculator inputs and results, including patient-reported outcome scores,
    are processed entirely within your browser.
    <strong>No patient data, clinical values, or questionnaire responses are
    transmitted to, stored on, or accessible by our servers.</strong>
    When you close or refresh the page, all entered data is permanently discarded.
    CSV exports are generated locally in your browser and downloaded directly to
    your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our service is intended for healthcare professionals and is not directed at children under 13.
    We do not knowingly collect information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
    posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
