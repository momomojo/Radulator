# Radulator Hermes release control plane

This overlay installs four disabled-first Hermes jobs: an exact-head primary clinical judge, an independent high-risk verification judge, a lifecycle reconciler, and a post-smoke learning worker. Standard-risk PRs require the primary signature; calculator/formula/threshold/management changes require both signatures.

Each judge run invokes the collector once and atomically claims at most one exact candidate, oldest PR first. A durable per-role lease prevents overlapping runs from reviewing the same candidate. Authoritative PASS or NEEDS_FIX readback clears the resolved lease on the next collection; unresolved attempts expire automatically, receive bounded retries, and then cool down while later PRs advance. This bounds model context without letting one failing PR starve the rest of the clinical queue.

The trusted merge controller explicitly dispatches the Pages workflow after an automatic merge to `main`; GitHub suppresses ordinary push-triggered workflows when the merge uses the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A trusted authorizer accepts only the exact current-main merged PR, and a scheduled reconciler retries a missing dispatch. The deployment remains eligible for the same post-deploy smoke and narrowly scoped rollback path.

If `develop` and `main` acquire equivalent trees through independent merge histories, reconcile their ancestry through a reviewed PR into `develop` before opening the production promotion. Disclose any documentation-only audit note accompanying that merge as an exact-head file change. Never force-push or bypass the signed gate to resolve a history-only promotion conflict.

## Prerequisites

- Use the canonical Radulator clone and pull the reviewed control-plane release before installation.
- The primary and verification Hermes homes must be distinct profiles. Both `config.yaml` files must set `agent.reasoning_effort: xhigh`; Hermes 0.19 has no per-job effort field.
- Both profiles need working GitHub authentication. Do not put tokens or private keys in this repository or in job prompts. Judge jobs resolve the trusted E2E workflow ID from authoritative GitHub workflow metadata on every collection/post and reject any configured identity mismatch.
- Judge collectors and posters prefer `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` when supplied and otherwise read the authenticated `gh` token without printing it. Verify `gh auth status` in the noninteractive Mac mini account before activation.
- The repository's protected checks, clinical gate, automatic merger, deployment smoke, and rollback workflows must already be active. An enforced repository ruleset for both `develop` and `main` must require `Radulator Clinical Release Authorization` from the GitHub Actions App with `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true`; the controller also verifies the paired fingerprint-bearing exact-head check through GitHub's metadata-readable APIs before every merge.

## Install and verify

On the Mac mini, inspect the proposed files/jobs without writing:

```bash
python3 ops/hermes/radulator/install.py \
  --repo /Users/agent/Documents/Radulator \
  --radulator-home /Users/agent/.hermes/profiles/radulator \
  --default-home /Users/agent/.hermes \
  --dry-run
```

Install jobs disabled and create the reversible baseline backup:

```bash
python3 ops/hermes/radulator/install.py \
  --repo /Users/agent/Documents/Radulator \
  --radulator-home /Users/agent/.hermes/profiles/radulator \
  --default-home /Users/agent/.hermes \
  --apply
```

Run self-tests before enabling:

```bash
npm run test:release-policy
npm run test:independent-review-gate
npm run test:auto-merge
npm run test:authorize-deployment
npm run test:reconcile-deployment
npm run test:post-deploy-smoke
npm run test:rollback-deployment
npm run test:hermes-judge-candidates
npm run test:hermes-judge-attest
npm run test:hermes-lifecycle
npm run test:hermes-learning
npm run test:hermes-install
npm run check:invariants
npm run lint -- --quiet
npm run build
```

Key creation is intentionally a separate, security-sensitive action. With operator approval, add `--generate-keys` to `--apply`. The command creates one `0600` Ed25519 private key in each profile, writes the identical public trust map to each profile's `keys/radulator-clinical/public-keys.json`, and prints `public_keys`, an object ready for the repository variable `RADULATOR_JUDGE_PUBLIC_KEYS_JSON`. Never copy private material to GitHub or between profiles. Re-running refuses an incomplete or mismatched pair and otherwise preserves the existing key.

After configuring the repository variable and strict branch rule, enable all managed jobs. The installer reads the repository variable back directly with the authenticated GitHub CLI and requires an exact match with both local trust maps:

```bash
python3 ops/hermes/radulator/install.py \
  --repo /Users/agent/Documents/Radulator \
  --radulator-home /Users/agent/.hermes/profiles/radulator \
  --default-home /Users/agent/.hermes \
  --github-repository momomojo/Radulator \
  --apply --enable
```

Activation requires `cron.max_parallel_jobs: 1` in both judge profiles and refuses missing/mismatched keys, a local/GitHub public-map mismatch, or any failed release, judge, deployment, lifecycle, invariant, lint, or build self-test. It then pauses legacy `pr-gate-poller` and `judge-queue` jobs in either judge profile with the reason `replaced-by-radulator-signed-clinical-gate`. Disabled-first installation leaves them unchanged, so there is no unguarded interval before the signed replacement is ready. The baseline restore returns both profiles' complete cron files—including those legacy jobs—to their exact pre-install bytes.

Production builds receive a controller-written `releases/<authorized-sha>.json` marker after the source build completes. Production smoke must retrieve and validate that exact marker before checking the home page, calculator, and sitemap; a CDN still serving the prior release cannot satisfy the deployment obligation.

The separate Claude Cloud `Radulator Production Gate` Routine is not stored in Hermes `jobs.json`; retire that Routine only after the signed replacement and staged canaries pass. GitHub Codex review may remain enabled as advisory feedback, but it is not a merge authority.

## Pause, rotate, and recover

Temporarily pause the complete control plane with the same command plus `--apply --disable`. This preserves jobs, keys, ledger, and restartability.

The active signer ids are deliberately versioned in reviewed code (`radulator-primary-v1` and `radulator-verification-v1`), and activation requires that exact two-role map. Rotation therefore requires a control-plane PR that advances both ids in the installer, prompts, expected trust map, and tests. Merge that change while jobs are disabled, reinstall disabled-first, generate the newly reviewed pairs with explicit operator approval, update and read back the GitHub variable, run signed canaries, and only then enable the new ids and archive the old private pairs outside Hermes. Do not attempt an ad-hoc extra key or overwrite/reuse an existing id; activation will reject it.

Restore the exact pre-install files from the protected baseline backup:

```bash
python3 ops/hermes/radulator/install.py \
  --radulator-home /Users/agent/.hermes/profiles/radulator \
  --restore
```

The backup manifest is `state/radulator-release-backup.json`; the active installation manifest is `state/radulator-release-control.json`. The lifecycle ledger is `state/radulator-release-lifecycle.jsonl`. Restore does not delete either judge's private keys or the lifecycle ledger.
