# Radulator ðŸ©»

A comprehensive radiology calculator application built with React and Vite, providing accurate medical calculations for radiologists and clinicians.

## Overview

Radulator is a modern web application that replicates and enhances the functionality of popular radiology calculators. It provides six specialized calculators for common radiological measurements and assessments, each with evidence-based formulas and proper academic references.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š **Medical Calculators**

1. **Adrenal CT Washout** - Calculate absolute and relative washout percentages for adrenal lesion characterization
2. **Adrenal MRI CSI** - Signal-intensity index and adrenal-to-spleen CSI ratio calculations
3. **Prostate Volume** - Ellipsoid volume estimation and PSA-Density calculations with PI-RADS integration
4. **Renal Cyst (Bosniak CT)** - Comprehensive Bosniak classification for cystic renal lesions
5. **Spleen Size (ULN)** - Gender and height-adjusted upper limits of normal spleen measurements
6. **Hip Dysplasia** - Migration index calculations with age-specific normal values

### ðŸŽ¨ **User Interface**
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Modern UI Components** - Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive Elements** - Radio buttons, checkboxes, and number inputs
- **Embedded Diagrams** - Visual references for measurement techniques
- **Professional Styling** - Clean, medical-grade interface design

### ðŸ“š **Academic Integration**
- **Evidence-Based Formulas** - All calculations based on peer-reviewed studies
- **Clickable References** - Direct links to original research papers
- **Comprehensive Citations** - Full academic references with DOIs
- **Clinical Interpretations** - Built-in result interpretation and ranges

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher)
- **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)
